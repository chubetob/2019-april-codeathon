# Venezuelan Diaspora - Solidarity System Indicators

## Who we are
The Red Humanitaria de los Caminantes, a network of entities in Colombia provides charity services for the “caminantes” (“walkers”), Venezuelans on the go, emigrating to or through Colombia. NEXT-STEP is an organization offering a microfinance program, with experience in Venezuela. As organizations of the Venezuelan diaspora we have acquired experience that allows us to understand the needs, problems and aspirations of Venezuelans as immigrants around the world.

## Problem statement
Over 3 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland and are working to get settled in a new country. There is a need to unite, collaborate, meet, and rejoice around everything that is Venezuelan in the countries that they are emigrating.
